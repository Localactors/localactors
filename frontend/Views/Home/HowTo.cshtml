                    <p>
                        Anybody can publish a project. You can be a registered NGO (non-governmental organisation),
                        other organisation or a single local actor taking on a project. As a PUBLISHER you
                        register yourself and prepare your project. We will give you all our support in
                        doing that. When you are ready, you publish your project and launch your request
                        for support.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Every project publisher sets their project's funding goal (support needed to get the project going) and a deadline for pledges. If SUPPORTERS like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen – their support is charged and attributed to the project. If the project succeeds in reaching its any of its financial milestones, it will receive the funds after the project deadline. If the project is cancelled, the pledged funds will be distributed to the remaining projects. If a project is successfully funded, <a href="http://localactors.org">LocalActors.org</a> applies a 4% administration fee to the funds collected.

                    <p>
                        There is a high degree of transparency in publishing the project and feedback on
                        progress. At the same time all communities can post their comments and references
                        in the visitors' book of each project. Your guarantee is the community. Good cause
                        projects can start small and grow. We recommend taking all projects step by step
                        and phase the funding as needed. We give each project dedicated support in planning
                        and monitoring. Your guarantee is the direct link between the supporter and the
                        project.

                        We support local action and we are willing to publish good cause - non-for-profit
                        - projects to help them get off the ground. Let it be a school coach trip, a new
                        dwelling in a village or a new service to help a local community. You can submit any
                        projects in line with our vision which is in need of little support in financing, knowledge
                        or materials to get things going.

                    <p>
                        If you have a project, through LocalActors.org you can directly address small donors
                        to get funding or other forms of support. Few of such websites exist,
                        but none is focusing on local not-for-profit projects while giving a chance a wide
                        range of set-ups. LocalActors.org puts you in contact with a large pool of passionate
                        supporters and helps you market your idea.

                    <p>
                        If you want to support a particular local project, you can choose to do so either
                        financially, with human resources or your skills.

                    <p>
                        We start as a small group of those not happy with the options available for small donors
                        - little transparency, no feedback and no visibility of what my contribution has
                        done. As a supporter to the local action we will make sure you will have all of
                        that, letting you know exactly where the support goes and which specific benefits
                        it brings.

                    What is your goal? What do you want to achieve and when? How much will it cost
                    and what other support you may need (perhaps, some materials, teachers etc.)? Keep
                    it simple, keep it phased. Plan for a year and say what you achieve in each quarter.
                    A project of 500 EUR will be easier to fund than a project of 2000 EUR. Think through
                    what you need most.

                    to take place and the calculated price of the trip (coach with the driver or

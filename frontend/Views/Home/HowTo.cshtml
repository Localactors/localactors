                    <p>
                        Anybody can publish a project. You can be a registered NGO (non-governmental organisation),
                        other organisation or a single local actor taking on a project. As a PUBLISHER you
                        register yourself and prepare your project. We will give you all our support in
                        doing that. When you are ready, you publish your project and launch your pledge
                        for support.
                    </p>
                </li>

                        <i></i><span class='hl'>How does it work with money?</span>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Every project publisher sets their project's funding goal (support needed to get
                        the project going) and deadline. If SUPPORTERS like the project, they can pledge
                        money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its minimum funding
                        goal (typically less then 100% when scalability of needs apply; we help to identify
                        it depending on the type of a project), all supporters' credit cards are charged
                        by the set deadline. If the project falls shorter than that, no one is charged.
                        If a project is successfully funded, LocalActors.org applies a 4% fee to the funds
                        collected.

                        <i></i><span class='hl'>What is my guarantee?</span>

                    <p>
                        There is a high degree of transparency in publishing the project and feedback on
                        progress. At the same time all community can post their comments and references
                        in the visitors' book of each project. Your guarantee is the community. Good cause
                        projects can start small and grow. We recommend taking all projects step by step
                        and phasing the funding needed. We give each project dedicated support in planning
                        and monitoring. Your guarantee is the direct link between the supporter and the
                        project.

                    <p>
                        We support local action and we are willing to publish good cause - non-for-profit
                        - projects to help them get off the ground. Let it be a school coach trip, a new
                        dwell in a village or a new service to help local community. You can submit any
                        projects in line with our vision and in need of little support in financing, knowledge
                        or materials to get things going.

                    <p>
                        If you have a project, through LocalActors.org you can address small donors directly
                        and world-wide to get fundings or other forms of support. Few of such websites exist,
                        but none is focusing on local non-for-profit projects while giving a chance to wide
                        range of set-ups. LocalActors.org puts you in contact with a large pool of passionate
                        supporters and helps you market your idea.

                        Currently LocalActors.org founding team and supporters are gathering first projects
                        and getting in touch with a kick-off community of users. During the early spring
                        a beta-test with self-registration of projects on the website will be held and in
                        Spring will be going live! In the meanwhile you can already submit a project. LocalActors.org
                        will process it, share it with different supporters and your project will be among
                        the first being published.

                    <p>
                        We start as a small group of those not happy with the options opened for small donors
                        - little transparency, no feedback and no visibility of what my contribution has
                        done. As a supporter to the local action we will make sure you will have all of
                        that, letting you know where exactly the support goes and which specific benefits
                        it brings.

                    What is your goal? What do you want to achieve and when? How much it will costs
                    and what other support you may need (perhaps, some materials, teachers etc.)? Keep
                    it simple, keep it phased. Plan for a year and say what you achieve in each quarter.
                    Project of 500 EUR will be easier to fund than a project of 2000 EUR. Think through
                    what you need most.

                    go - what they get from the trip, how your choose the 40, when is the trip expected
                    to take place and calculate the price of the trip (coach with the driver or also

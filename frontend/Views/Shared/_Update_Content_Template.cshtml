            <span class="question">Is she dead, yes or no?</span> The path of the righteous
            man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
            men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak
            through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder
            of lost children.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question">Ok, but how?</span> And I will strike down upon thee with
            great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy
            My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon
            thee.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="question">Are you ready for the truth?</span> You think water moves
            fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
            world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to
            climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
            seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath,
            that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,
            but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
